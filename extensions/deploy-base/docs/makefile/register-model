Command:
    register-model      : Register a trained model as "experiment:version" in AzureML.
        This uses (and requires) to have the Azure ML CLI v2 installed. In order to be able to
        deploy a trained model, we need to register it in Azure ML first.

        It expects a trained model in the folder `./models` named exactly
        `<experiment_name>-<version>.<filetype>`

Arguments:
    exp [Required]      : Name of the experiment for which to register model; it is defined by the
                          folder name containing the experiment.
    version [Required]  : Version of the experiment that is being registered.
    filetype [Required] : Type of file of the trained model.
    xargs               : Extra arguments to be passed to `az ml model create`. It should be a
                          single string.

Examples:
    Register a TorchServe ready .mar model
        make register-model exp=torch version=1 filetype=mar
