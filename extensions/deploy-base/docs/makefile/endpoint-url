Command:
    endpoint-url        : Obtain URL of an existing online managed endpoint in Azure ML.
        This uses (and requires) to have the Azure ML CLI v2 installed. In order to make calls
        to the endpoint, we need to know the URL of the endpoint. This command fetches it. Note
        that by default, the returned URL ends with `/score`. If you deploy using a custom
        container, which we recommend, the end of the URL might be different. To make calls to it,
        you will need to strip `/score` with the specifics of your deployment.

Arguments:
    endpoint [Required] : Name of the endpoint. It should match the value of key `name`
                          in the YAML whose name should also be the same value.

Examples:
    Fetch the URL for an existing managed endpoint
        make endpoint-url endpoint=my-unique-name
