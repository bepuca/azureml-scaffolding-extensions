Command:
    torchserve-archive  : Archive scripted PyTorch model.
        Use torch model archiver to create a `.mar` file ready for deployment in TorchServe.
        Requires:
         - `<experiment_name>-<version>.pt` file in `./models` folder. The saved model
                should be saved using torchscript so a definition python file is not required.
         - `handler.py` inside the `deploy` folder inside your experiment folder.
         - Formatting environment activated and `torch-model-archiver` installed in it.
        Outputs a `<experiment_name>-<version>.mar` file in the `./models` folder.

Arguments:
    exp     [Required] : Name of the experiment for which to archive model; it is defined by the
                         folder name containing the experiment.
    version [Required] : Version (integer) of the model being archived.
    xargs              : Extra arguments to be passed to torch model archiver. It should be a single
                         string.

Examples:
    Archive the version 2 of experiment `my_experiment`.
        make torchserve-archive exp=my_experiment version=2
