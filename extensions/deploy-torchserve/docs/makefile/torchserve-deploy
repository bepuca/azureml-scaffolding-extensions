Command:
    torchserve-deploy   : Deploy a registered TorchServe model.
        It deploys a previously registered TorchServe model (i.e., PyTorch model archived with
        torch-model-archiver) specified by the experiment name and the version. The deployment
        is added under the specified endpoint.

        Make sure that the `instance_type` and `instance_count` keys in the
        `torchserve-deployment.yaml` that lives in the deploy folder of the experiment are set to
        what you need.

        Note that no traffic will be allocated to the new deployment until you modify the
        endpoint YAML and update it with the `make update-endpoint`.

Arguments:
    exp [Required]        : Name of the experiment for which to deploy model; it is defined by the
                            folder name containing the experiment.
    version [Required]    : Version (integer) of the model being archived.
    endpoint [Required]   : Endpoint name in which to add the deployment.
    deployment [Required] : Deployment name. It is recommended to give it a meaningful name to
                            understand what is deployed at any point in time.

Examples:
    Deploy the version 3 of super_experiment into unique-endpoint
        make torchserve-deploy exp=my_experiment version=3 endpoint=unique-endpoint deployment=my_experiment-3
